# Road to Gymnastics

Road to Gymnastics is a fitness app that will get an individual ready to for gymnastics. Currently it is in development with the use of a sample API and in need of major changes in the UI (currently a temporary UI is being used). The app is capable of generating a workout regiment randomly, a unique feature for fitness apps.
